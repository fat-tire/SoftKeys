<div class="header">Getting Started:</div>

<p>SoftKeys is a home screen replacement and on screen service that
provides virtual buttons for home, menu, back, and search.  In order to
use SoftKeys you must have a working SuperUser installation on your
device.</p>

<p>The first time you run SoftKeys from the "home" button, it may look like
nothing happens because the default configuration is to pass you through to
your configured home screen.  If you've never configured SoftKeys, this
will simply be the first one it finds on the device.  To open the SoftKeys
home button interface, you will need to "double tap" the hardware home button.
This behaviour can be changed in the settings.</p>

<p>If you are using SoftKeys for the first time you should double-tap home,
press the <b>Settings</b> button, and set your default home screen under
<b>Virtual Home Button</b> - <b>Normal Press</b></p>

<p>If you just want to just use the service and not the hardware home
button behaviors, just set your default home to whatever launcher you like
and then start SoftKeys from that launcher.  The service can still run even
if you don't make SoftKeys your default home application.</p>

<div class="header">Tips:</div>

<ul>
    <li>If you disable the "Settings" button, you can still get to the
settings by using your hardware menu key.  If you don't have a hardware
menu key, you can long-press on the SoftKeys center empty area of the
screen to bring up the settings.</li>
    <li>Help is available through either the SoftKeys menu via the hardware
menu button, or from the settings under "About SoftKeys", or by <a href="help.html">clicking here.</a></li>
    <li>You can drag the service windows around the screen, the service bar
can be dragged by the "Close" button.  The D-Pad window can be dragged by
the top left and right corners where there are no buttons.</li>
    <li>You can rotate SoftKeys service bar popup by long-pressing on the
"Close" button</li>
    <li>Long-prses the service popper button to show or hide the D-Pad</li>
    <li>To configure the custom keys, long-press on the + or - below the
D-Pad</li>
    <li>By default, long-press on the virtual home button in the service
bar will bring up the main SoftKeys interface to access settings and view
recent activities.</li>
</ul>
